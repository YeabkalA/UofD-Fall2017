University of Dallas Fall 2017 Mobile Development for iOS Class

This repo is meant to contain notes, assignment examples, slide decks, and so on for the Fall 2017 session of Mobile Development for iOS class taught at the University of Dallas.

If there's something you expect to see here that you don't see, let me know and I'll work to provide that information.

You can reach me using my email (rmirabelli@udallas.edu) at any reasonable time. Office hours are available by appointment.

I will be providing reading suggestions as the semester engages. There is no textbook required for this class.

The exact order of topics we will cover in class will be determined by student interest and progression. There are so many possible things to discuss that it's impossible to cover each of them in detail. Instead, we'll focus on learning the design patterns behind each of the topics we cover, so that further exploration is possible.

That being said:

Week one: Swift (part one), the MVC pattern, setting up an Apple Developer account, and the mobile ecosystem.
