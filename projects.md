# Projects

This class is graded entirely based upon projects completed by the students. There will be no exams.

## Project 1 (10%) Due Sept 7, 10pm CST

This first project is meant to measure your ability to perform basic tasks within Xcode and Swift, so as to catch
any possible problems before they become critical and prevent success as the class goes on.

The project requirements are:
* create a project repository in GitHub, and provide your instructor with a URL (or invite him to a private repo if
you prefer)
* create a new project in Xcode (single screen application)
* place two buttons on the screen, one for incrementing and one for decrementing
* place a label on the screen showing the current value

Successfully completing these steps will earn a grade of 90%. In order to achieve a higher score, complete one or
more of the following additions:
* support iPad interfaces
* support screen rotation
* provide an interesting graphical effect, such as a background color changing based upon the values

Points will be deducted for the following reasons:
* nonexistent documentation
* over-documentation
* template code left in the project
* other code smells

## Project 2 (20%) Due Sept 30, 11pm CST

In this project, you're going to build a photo browser using a collection view.

## Project 3 (30%) Due Oct 21, 11pm CST

In this project, you're going to build a (very) lightweight social network.

## Project 4 (40%) Due Dec 5, 11pm CST

This is a capstone project. Build something you want to see brought into the world.
